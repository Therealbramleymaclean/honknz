        <h2>Frequently Honked</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>So what is it exactly that you do?</h3>
            <p>We take in wine without a home, make it something more than just excess or leftovers.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why auctions?</h3>
            <p>We run a range of auctions, both online and in person. We want to provide a space where people with any
                budget can afford something unique and special.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What makes this wine more than cleanskin labelled?</h3>
            <p>Nothing really. It's not that we don't care for the taste - rather we want to make something more
                interesting
                than the lines of bottles at the supermarket that entice with the same label with a different font.</p>
            <p>Our artists put in hours. Time spent staring at unlablled bottles, trying different techniques, and
                bringing their work to life. If you're here for the wine, keep a look out for partnered bottles, those
                that we hand pick with wineries for short runs of exquisite taste, and of course, stunning look. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
            <p>A three way split between the artist, their chosen charity, and Goose & Cork.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Can I become an artist too?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! We are here to make it as easy as possible to bring your creativity to life. <a

                    in touch.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>I have excess/unlablled wine, can we work together?</h3>
            <p>Check out Parnters in Wine. We are looking for wineries to work alongside to make something beautiful.
